# Implement your Redux-Thunk Project to React Hooks in 5 steps

This project demonstrate how to implement a basic header with a response data from mock api.

Master branch is a project using React-Redux structure
Hooks branch demonstrates an exact project but using hooks.

I will write a blog to break it down in 5 steps, later.

## Run this project by yourself

## Redux-Thunk example

we are using json-server to build a mock data server

```bash
npm i
npm run mockdev
```

## Hooks example

```bash
git checkout hooks
npm i
npm run mockdev
```
